## See and Think: Disentangling Semantic Scene Completion

*However, they not only exploit few semantic features, but are highly customized for a specific sensor.*
*However, it takes a single depth image as input and does not take advantage of rich features of RGB.*
*In SSCNet [1], the scene surface without semantic information is encoded into a volume for completion and all the convolutions have fixed receptive fields*

Afterwards, [6, 24] attempt to add RGB features into the network. Overall, in the aspect of task solving, these networks introduce a tight coupling between RGB and depth so that their extensibility and evolvability are constrained.
